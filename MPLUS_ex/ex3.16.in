    TITLE:	this is an example of a path analysis
    	with continuous dependent variables,
    	bootstrapped standard errors, indirect
    	effects, and non-symmetric bootstrap confidence intervals
    DATA:	FILE IS ex3.11.dat;
    VARIABLE:	NAMES ARE y1-y3 x1-x3;
    ANALYSIS:	BOOTSTRAP = 1000;
    MODEL:	y1 y2 ON x1 x2 x3;
    	y3 ON y1 y2 x2;
    MODEL INDIRECT:
    	y3 IND y1 x1;
    	y3 IND y2 x1;
    OUTPUT:	CINTERVAL (BOOTSTRAP);
