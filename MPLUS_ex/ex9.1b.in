    TITLE:	this is an example of a two-level
    	regression analysis for a continuous
    	dependent variable with a random intercept and a latent covariate
    DATA:	FILE = ex9.1b.dat;
    VARIABLE:	NAMES = y x w clus;
    	BETWEEN = w;
    	CLUSTER = clus;
    DEFINE: CENTER x (GRANDMEAN);
    ANALYSIS:	TYPE = TWOLEVEL;
    MODEL:
    	%WITHIN%	
    	y ON x (gamma10);
    	%BETWEEN%
    	y ON w
    	x (gamma01);
    MODEL CONSTRAINT:
    	NEW(betac);
    	betac = gamma01 - gamma10;
